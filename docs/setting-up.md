# Setting up HomeStation 2

You'll need:
- Git
- Cargo
- Rust (1.38 or newer)
- Windows / Linux / Mac
- A while.

If you want to deploy it to a Raspberry Pi, you'll also need a Raspberry Pi with a X.Org Server (you won't need any
window manager though, just pure X.Org will do) and some compatible LCD.

I personally run the station on a Raspberry Pi Zero, but it should work on all the other versions too without any
changes.
